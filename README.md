# burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, this app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.
This app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

This is the first project I had to use ORM completely. It's a lot of moving parts, but I do appreciate the organization with folders and seeing how it all works. The Heroku deployment was the biggest challenge for me.
